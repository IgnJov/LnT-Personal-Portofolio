# LnT-Personal-Portofolio

**Description**

This website is my portfolio which contains a brief description of myself and some of the projects I have worked on. In addition, there is also a form that you can fill out to contact me.

This website was created as the final project of the Learning and Teaching program from the BNCC (Bina Nusantara Computer Club) front-end development field.

The design of the website is made on the Figma application. This project uses HTML/CSS technology and the Bootstrap framework to create the appearance of the website. In addition, JavaScript is used for the functionality of the contact us form which allows visitors to send me messages. Data from received messages will be stored in a NoSQL Database that utilizes Cloud Firestore technology. The work is done through Visual Studio Code and the website is hosted on the Github Pages service.
